# bayesian-nn
Exploratory work with Bayesian neural networks

### Goals

I will try out different bayesian nn frameworks

[Tensorflow probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/)<br>
[Pytorch Blitz](https://github.com/piEsposito/blitz-bayesian-deep-learning)<br>
[Pytorch pyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/pyro)<br>
[Pytorch botorch](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch)<br>
[Pytorch BayesianCNN](https://github.com/kumar-shridhar/PyTorch-BayesianCNN)<br>
